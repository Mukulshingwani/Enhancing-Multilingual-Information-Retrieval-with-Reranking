# Enhancing-Multilingual-Information-Retrieval-with-Reranking
Deep Learning Course Project

## Overview
In this project, a multilingual reranking pipeline is being developed using Mono language sentence embeddings and knowledge distillation. The first step involves creating models for cross language sentence embeddings using knowledge distillation techniques and concepts of student-teacher network. Then this sentence embedding models are used to create the Multilingual Biencoder structures which in turn as used for reranking and can be potentialy used for many applications also.
